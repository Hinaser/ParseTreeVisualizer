      <h1>Learn how parse tree looks like</h1>
      <p>
      Parse tree is a term usually used in compiler technology and language recognition area.
      </p>

      <p>
      In those industries, `analyzing text data` is sometimes the same as `making parse tree based on a target grammar`.<br />
      This web site is made to visualize parse tree of any uploaded text based on a grammar written in Antlr4 specification.
      </p>

      <p>
      In brief, this parse tree thing is referred when someone needs to utilize parsing result of some text written in target grammar.<br/>
      Comprehensive example is machine translation from English to Japanese.<br />
      By creating parse tree by applying lexical analysis and syntax analysis against original English text,<br />
      computer can recognize a word whether it is a noun or verb, or which adjective adorns a word.

      <p>
      As an example, let''s see how an ASP(Active Server Pages) text is converted into a parse tree.<br>
      Some text written in ASP syntax:
      </p>
      <pre><%
<br>Private Sub Command1_Click ()
<br>    Text1.Text = "Hello, world!"
<br>End Sub
<br>%>
      </pre>
      <p>will be parse to</p>
      <img src="%{parse_tree_sample}">
      <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
      Computer can easily recognize that there is a `Sub` statement and its visibility is Private.<br/>
      Furthermore, it is also understandable that argument of the sub statement is empty.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
      This parse tree is a production from `input text` and `parsing rule`.<br/>
      How to create parsing rule depends on what parser you choose.<br/>
      In this website, parsing rule is written by Antlr, a famous parser generator tool.<br/>
      There are similar kind of tools like flex/bison, which are used to parse html on web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
      Here comes Antlr.<br>
      Antlr is a parser generator. How text should be parsed can be defined with Antlr.<br>
