      <h1>Learn how parse tree looks like</h1>
      <p>
      Parse tree is a term usually used in compiler technology and language recognition area.<br />
      In those industries, `analyzing text data` is sometimes the same as `making parse tree based on a target grammar`.<br />
      This web site is made to visualize parse tree of any uploaded text based on a grammar written in Antlr4 specification.
      </p>

      <p>
      As an example, let''s see how an ASP(Active Server Pages) text is converted into a parse tree.<br>
      Some text written in ASP syntax:
      </p>
      <pre><%
<br>Private Sub Command1_Click ()
<br>    Text1.Text = "Hello, world!"
<br>End Sub
<br>%>
      </pre>
      <p>will be parse to</p>
      <img src="%{parse_tree_sample}">
      <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
      How is parse tree generated from original text?<br>
      Obviously, someone needs to define that `how`.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      Here comes Antlr.<br>
      Antlr is a parser generator. How text should be parsed can be defined with Antlr.<br>
      For more detail about Antlr, please refer to <a href="http://www.antlr.org">its official website</a>.
